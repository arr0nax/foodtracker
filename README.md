# Food Tracker

#### A Website to track Food Consumption

#### By **Clayton Collins**

## Description

This site allows the user to track the food that they eat. Users can input foods and then consume them, adding to their total calorie count for the day. Plus it looks fun to keep them coming back!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Run `npm install` and `bower install` in the project directory
* Run `gulp serve` to start the development server
* Navigate to localhost:3000


## Known Bugs

The site accepts blank inputs which I hope to change in the future. Also if calories is not a number, the total calories will become NaN and wont recover.


## Support and contact details
